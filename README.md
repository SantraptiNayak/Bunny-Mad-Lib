# Bunny-Mad-Lib
Mad libs generator is a fun game that is usually played by kids. In this python game user has to enter substitutes for blanks in the story without knowing the story. It will be fun to read aloud the stories after filling the blanks.

The design of the code for the Mad Libs with Python should be in a manner that it should ask users to input a series of entries which will be considered a Mad Lib. User input can be anything, be it an adjective, a noun, or a pronoun. Once all of the entries are entered, your program should take the entries and organize them all in the form of a story.
